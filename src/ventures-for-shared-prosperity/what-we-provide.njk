      What we provide our entrepreneurs
    </h1>
    <p class="hero__body g-max-4">
      Starting a business is risky, and for many individuals without a personal 
      financial safety net, or access to a network of individuals with 
      significant capital to fund their venture, the risk is simply too high. 
      We view this as an unacceptable barrier to entry for entrepreneurship and 
      believe that it is both unfair, and reduces the volume and quality of new 
      businesses as many individuals with the talent, motivation and passion to 
      start their own business are unable to. At the ideas42 Venture Studio we 
      can’t guarantee your success, but we can reduce your risk of trying to 
      build an amazing business, and support those entrepreneurs who don’t have 
      access today.
    </p>
    <p class="callout font-size-3 g-max-3">
      If you are selected to join the ideas42 Venture Studio as an 
      entrepreneur, we will pay you a <strong>salary</strong> ($75k per year), and provide 
      <strong>benefits</strong> for 18 months, while surrounding you with a dedicated <strong>team</strong> 
      of business builders, and behavioral scientists to help bring your 
      vision to life.

        Building a business is hard. Building a large, socially impactful 
        business is even harder. It shouldn’t require you to risk everything to 
        give it a go. Join us. Build something amazing. We don’t have all the 
        answers and we won’t have it all figured out when you join us. But we 
        know it takes a solid foundation to build a thriving technology 
        business. We provide that foundation.
