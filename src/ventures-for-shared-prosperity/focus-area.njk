      The Excess Costs of Poverty
    </h1>
    <p class="hero__body g-max-3-half">
      There are tens of millions of people in the U.S. who face chronic hunger, 
      housing insecurity, inadequate healthcare, and a daily struggle to make 
      ends meet. The causes of poverty are diverse, complex, and often 
      structural, and the consequences are catastrophic at an individual and 
      societal level.

        Our inaugural cohort of entrepreneurs at 
        <a href="/ventures-for-shared-prosperity">Ventures for Shared Prosperity</a>  
        will focus on building businesses that 
        improve the lives of millions by reducing the costs for those living 
        in poverty. While most anti-poverty efforts focus (justifiably) on 
        increasing incomes and economic opportunity, an often-ignored part of 
        the equation is the reality that living in poverty in America is 
        <a href="https://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/I42_PovertyWhitePaper_Digital_FINAL-1.pdf">incredibly expensive (PDF).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In partnership with our first cohort of entrepreneurs we will work to 
        alleviate the pernicious ways that the “poverty tax” manifests itself. 
        Read on if you want to learn 
        more about the problem, and where we see opportunities to build large, 
        sustainable, impact businesses.

      <p class="font-size-3">
        In order to identify potential business opportunities, it's important to 
        first understand the many different forms that the poverty tax takes: 
      </p>

      {% headingAnchor "3", "Direct financial costs" %}
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Higher Costs:</strong>
            For those who live on low incomes, many goods and services are simply 
            more expensive than they are for wealthier families. From more 
            expensive financial statements to higher car insurance rates to paying 
            more for everyday goods like toilet paper, people living in poverty 
            spend billions more on many products and services than people with 
            greater income and wealth.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Disproportionate Costs:</strong>
            Other costs are technically the same for everyone, but they 
            disproportionately impact people living in poverty. Many of these, 
            like court fines and fees, are predominantly borne by people of color with lower incomes, 
            while others, like security deposits for rental 
            housing, have an outsized downstream impact on people who can’t 
            afford them, reducing housing security, mobility, and affordability.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Deferred Costs:</strong>
            Without sufficient liquidity or access to affordable credit, 
            families with lower incomes often have no choice but to purchase cheaper, 
            lower-quality assets. When these assets - such as cars or household 
            appliances - need repairs, families must incur additional expenses 
            to fix or replace them, resulting in a higher total cost of 
            ownership.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      {% headingAnchor "3", "Non-financial costs" %}
      <p>
        In addition to financial costs, individuals with lower incomes also face higher 
        temporal costs (e.g. spending more time on caregiving), administrative costs, 
        and cognitive costs (the near-constant trade-off decisions one must make 
        when managing scarce resources) than individuals with higher incomes.
      </p>

      {% headingAnchor "2", "Opportunities" %}
      <p class="font-size-3">
        We have identified six specific facets of life where the poverty tax is 
        significant. This list is not meant to be comprehensive, nor is it 
        necessarily the case that each of these problems has a credible software 
        powered, behavioral science informed solution. Instead, they are 
        illustrative of the kinds of problems in the excess costs space that we 
        anticipate our first cohort of entrepreneurs will explore in partnership 
        with our business design team.
      </p>

      {% headingAnchor "3", "1. Housing" %}
      <p>
        1 in 4 renters are spending at least 50% of their wages on housing 
        and utilities. Tragically, these costs not only represent a larger 
        portion of the budgets of people with lower incomes, they’re also greater in 
        real terms. Renters with lower incomes, especially those of color, are 
        routinely overcharged relative to market values, and these 
        discrepancies persist for homeowners with Black families paying higher 
        property taxes and receiving more expensive mortgage loans.
      </p>
      {% headingAnchor "3", "2. Transportation" %}
      <p>
        For families living on low-incomes, finding a way to get around 
        town - to work, to the store, to childcare - can be a major 
        challenge. Buying and maintaining a car can be prohibitively 
        expensive, but the alternative - relying on public transit systems 
        that require multiple transfers to get from Point A to B - can also 
        have prohibitively high time and opportunity costs. And while COVID 
        has transformed the daily commute for many to a short walk down the 
        hallway, the same can’t be said for the 43% of Black and Latinx 
        workers who work in jobs that can’t be done remotely (compared to 
        around 25% for white workers).
      </p>
      {% headingAnchor "3", "3. Employment" %}
      <p>
        Unpredictable work schedules characterize the professional lives of 
        millions of workers -- especially women of color -- and impose 
        devastating cognitive, physical, and economic costs. The result is an 
        increased incidence of hunger, housing hardships, and psychological 
        distress for families, and higher job turnover for employers. 
        Furthermore, gig workers and employees in many part-time and hourly jobs 
        lack key benefits, like employer-subsidized health, disability, and 
        unemployment insurance. Without these critical supports, the future 
        costs of dealing with health and economic shocks are much much higher.
      </p>
      {% headingAnchor "3", "4. Health" %}
      <p>
        More than 25% of U.S. adults age 18-64 struggle to pay their medical 
        bills, and as with so many other costs, this debt disproportionately 
        impacts individuals with lower incomes and people of color. In addition to 
        pushing families into bankruptcy, this debt has a compounding impact on 
        future costs: damaging credit scores and making borrowing more 
        expensive, leading to late fees on missed bills, and increasing future 
        healthcare costs, which arise due to delayed medical care.
      </p>
      {% headingAnchor "3", "5. Food and retail" %}
      <p>
        With limited liquidity, individuals living on low incomes are often 
        unable to take advantage of fee-based wholesale services or bulk 
        discounts (e.g. buy two, get one free) at grocery stores, resulting 
        in excess annual costs of over $5 billion. Similarly, due to the 
        inability to purchase furniture and appliances outright, many 
        individuals with lower incomes rely on rent-to-own companies which can often 
        charge twice as much in total costs.
      </p>
      {% headingAnchor "3", "6. Financial services" %}
      <p>
        Whether it's exorbitant payday loan interest rates, overdraft fees, or 
        prepaid card fees, individuals with lower incomes face a wide array 
        of costs related to financial services that individuals with higher incomes do 
        not. Estimates of those costs continue to grow each year and were 
        estimated at $196 billion in 2019.

        We are deeply aware that the causes of poverty are diverse, complex, and 
        often structural. While market-based solutions can improve people’s 
        financial health, they are not a panacea. We are incredibly proud to be 
        doing this work as part of a broader team - the 
        <a href="https://sharedprosperity.ideas42.org">Shared Prosperity Catalyst</a> - 
        that will simultaneously be working to change the narratives around 
        poverty in America and shape the policies that can help - and too often 
        hurt - people with lower incomes.
