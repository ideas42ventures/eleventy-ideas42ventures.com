      With support from Wells Fargo we are looking for talented individuals to join 
      us as entrepreneurs in our 18-month business co-building program. The first 
      cohort will start DATE, and we are going to focus on building businesses that 
      reduce the excess costs of poverty in America. Do you have the heart and soul 
      of an entrepreneur? A passion for solving huge social challenges? 
      <a href="/apply">
        Apply to be a member of our first cohort of entrepreneurs.
      </a>
    </p>
    <p class="font-size-2">
      Not sure you are ready to apply? Attend a Q&A session to learn more about what we provide our 
      entrepreneurs, how we think about building scalable, impactful 
      businesses, and why we think tackling the problem of the excess costs 
      of poverty is an important one. At Ventures for Shared Prosperity we believe 
      we can help improve the lives of individuals living in poverty by partnering 
      with talented entrepreneurs to build and scale software powered, behavioral 
      science informed businesses that address some of the diverse, complex and 
      structural causes of poverty in America.
