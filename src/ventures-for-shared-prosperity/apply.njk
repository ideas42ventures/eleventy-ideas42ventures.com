      With support from Wells Fargo we’re recruiting entrepreneurs to build 
      businesses to address the excess costs of poverty. We’re looking for 
      people that know if given the time, the money, and the audience, they can 
      channel their lived experiences, ideas, and talents into positive impact.

      Our process is set up to give you the opportunity to show and tell us 
      the impacts you want to make. It’s an opportunity for you to express 
      yourself in the ways you’re most comfortable.

      There’s no one way to be a entrepreneur. Some entrepreneurs will have a strong 
      track record of work with a particular social problem. Others might 
      have particular technical, design, or business skills. But all of our 
      entrepreneurs will be excited about using technology to solve social 
      problems, and will bring this excitement and deep passion to their work. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, our entrepreneurs will bring <strong>direct, lived experience</strong> of the 
      challenges Americans from underrepresented communities face to their work. 
      What is lived experience? It might be the knowledge of our broken 
      healthcare system that you have from spending hours on the phone with an 
      insurance company. Or maybe it’s what you know about the challenges of 
      unpredictable shift scheduling from juggling multiple part-time jobs. Put 
      simply, we believe that having a direct connection to the myriad 
      challenges facing people with low incomes will help entrepreneurs build 
      stronger, more impactful businesses, and will sustain our entrepreneurs’ 
      passion through the inevitable ups and downs of starting a business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from this experience, our entrepreneurs will have several key traits. 
      They will be <strong>resourceful</strong>: able to inspire others to work for, fund, and 
      contribute to their eventual company. They will be <strong>gritty</strong>: able to stick 
      with the challenges of starting a business, especially when it is hard. 
      They will be <strong>emotionally mature</strong>: able to understand the perspectives of 
      others and interrogate their own perspectives when making challenging 
      decisions. They will have <strong>high acceleration</strong>: able to start solving a 
      problem with something small and grow it quickly. And importantly, they 
      will be <strong>creative</strong>: able to think of novel solutions to complex problems.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="font-size-3 has-end-cap g-max-3 apply__entrepreneurs">
    There are many ways to demonstrate these traits: through work and 
    professional experience, through volunteering, or through other personal 
    experiences. We care about what you’ve done in the past, but we care more 
    about what you <strong>can do</strong> in the future. If these traits sound like you, and 
    you’re excited about the chance to make social impact through technology, 
    we encourage you to apply.
