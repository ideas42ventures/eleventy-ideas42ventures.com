## Cohort Entrepreneurs

### What will I get as an entrepreneur at the ideas42 Venture studio?

- [Salary and benefits](/ventures-for-shared-prosperity/what-we-provide/#compensation-package)
- [Support from our team of five](/ventures-for-shared-prosperity/what-we-provide/#technical-and-business-building-support)
- [Capital to spend on sales, marketing, travel, software development](/ventures-for-shared-prosperity/what-we-provide/#business-building-capital)

### What if I want to partner with one of the other cohort entrepreneurs to start a business together?

That would be awesome. We aren’t dogmatic about sole founders vs co-founders (we think Venture Studio leads serve as a quasi co-founder for sole founders, with lots of the upside of a co-founder experience, with less of the downside), but we would want to work with each of you to ensure both of you are comfortable with the decision making structure and areas of responsibility. It would also change your ownership stake in the business, but that is up to you to decide if it’s worth it.

### Do I need to have any software development experience to apply to be a founder?

Nope! Software development experience is valuable, but so are many other experiences and no one has every valuable experience. Part of our role at the Studio is ensuring you have the talent around you to fill the gaps (reminder, everyone has gaps!) in your experience set.

### Do you care what level of education I have?

Nope.

### What do you think are the core skills necessary to be a successful entrepreneur?

Check out our [apply](/apply) page for some details on our thinking, but the most important thing is whether you believe you can be a successful entrepreneur.

### Why are you focused on building software businesses?

We don’t think software can solve every problem, or even most problems, but there are some problems that software is very good at solving (and sadly lots of problems software is good at exacerbating) and as software developers and behavioral scientists it’s one of the tools we use to scale our impact.

### Do I have to move to be an entrepreneur at the ideas42 Venture Studio?

Nope.

### If I start a business while an entrepreneur at the ideas42 Venture Studio what will my stake be in the business?

Entrepreneurs who join as a part of the Ventures for Shared Prosperity will own 40% (vesting over five years) in the business they start while at the studio. We hold aside 10% for an employee stock option pool and the ideas42 Venture Studio owns 50%, between Studio investors, Studio owners and Studio employees.

## Legal

### What is the legal structure of the Venture Studio?

We are a public benefit corporation, wholly owned by ideas42, a 501c(3) non-profit corporation.

### Who are your investors currently?

All investment capital in the Venture Studio to date has come from ideas42, and any financial return from businesses started in the studio will go to ideas42 and the Venture Studio employees.

### What role does Wells Fargo play in the Ventures for Shared Prosperity effort?

The Wells Fargo foundation has made a generous three year commitment to ideas42 for the [Shared Prosperity Catalyst](https://sharedprosperity.ideas42.org), a multi-pronged approach to improve the financial health and well-being of low and moderate income people in America. Ventures for Shared Prosperity is one of those three prongs, but Wells Fargo has no financial stake in any of the ventures we launch and no control over what kinds of businesses we build.
