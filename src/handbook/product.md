## Product

The goal of this document is to paint a vivid picture of how we build technology projects for you, the reader. If we have not accomplished that as a whole or in individual sections, email Tyler at [tyler@ideas42ventures.com](mailto:tyler@ideas42ventures.com) and let him know.

This is how we build technology products. We use the principles and processes described here when making both long-term strategic decisions and day-to-day tactical decisions.

Note that Design and Engineering are within Product, not separate. This is by design. All Design and Engineering is in service of the products we build.

### For Entrepreneurs

If you are thinking about applying to join the Studio or already a part of it, this is here to give as clear a picture as possible of how we’ll build products together. Every product development process is different, but they all have overlapping characteristics. We’ll use the principles, processes, and technology described here to bring your product to life.

### For Candidates

If you are thinking about applying to join the Studio or already in the interview process, this is here to give you as clear a picture as possible about our day to day work. And to give you an idea of the expectations we’ll have of you depending on your role.

### For Team Members

### Principles

These are a select few principles that we follow. They’re inspired and informed by others’ similar principles. Some specific lists we’ve taken inspiration from include, but are not limited to:

- [GOV.UK Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
- [Calm Technology](https://calmtech.com)
- [GitLab Product Principles](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#our-product-principles)

#### 1. Start with problems, not solutions

At every point in the product life cycle we must work towards defining, refining, and clearly communicating root problems. There must be a shared understanding of the problems we’re working to solve.

**If you don’t have a problem to solve, don’t work on solutions.**

#### 2. Do no harm

Before building any product feature we must first consider how it could cause or be used to cause harm to people. Nothing should be considered too far fetched, if we can think of a way to use our products to do harm, so will others.

**If it will do harm, don’t do it.**

#### 3. Accessibility is a requirement, not a feature

Accessible products are good for everyone. Everything we build must be as inclusive, legible, and readable as possible. Accessibility is not something we add on at the end, it’s the way we build.

**If something will break accessibility, pick something else.**

#### 4. Do one thing well

It’s better to do a single thing well than many things poorly. At every point in the product life cycle we must prioritize ruthlessly to stay focused on doing that one thing well.

**If the product or feature isn’t doing the single thing well, don’t do other things.**

#### 5. Iterate

Our first attempts will be wrong. Our second attempts may be wrong. Our third, our fourth, and so on may be wrong. That is what we need. Every iteration we make helps us learn more and get closer to an ideal solution.

**Can we ship a thing that doesn’t violate other principles that we can continue to improve? Do that.**

### Design

We follow the [Rule of Least Power](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html) when making all design decisions.

#### Tools

- **Pencil and paper**: Don’t forget about these, they are your friends. We sketch and draw ideas for fast iteration and sharing.
- **Figma**: This is our primary UI design software. We’ve chosen it over alternatives because it’s open by default.
- **Adobe Illustrator**: This is our preferred vector illustration tool. If you’re producing illustrations and need to share a working file, this is what we want.
- **Adobe Photoshop**: This is our preferred raster illustration tool. If you’re producing raster photo illustrations and need to share a working file, this is what we want.
