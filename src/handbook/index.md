The ideas42 Venture Studio handbook is the home for information about how we operate. One of our [company values](/about/#our-values) is transparency. Making our handbook open to the public is one thing we do towards being as transparent as possible.

We warmly welcome feedback. You can send us any feedback to our general email address [info@ideas42ventures.com](mailto:info@ideas42ventures.com.). Some sections of the handbook of more specific email addresses for section maintainers.

The source code for the handbook, and this entire site, is also publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ideas42ventures/ideas42ventures.com). If youâ€™re comfortable providing feedback in the form of an issue or pull request, those are also welcome.
