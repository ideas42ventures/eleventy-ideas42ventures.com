        Our first cohort of entrepreneurs at Ventures for Shared Prosperity started in February 2020, and we are starting recruitment for our second cohort soon. Both cohorts will focus on improving the financial health and well-being of low and moderate income people in America, specifically by looking for ways to reduce the excess costs of poverty.
