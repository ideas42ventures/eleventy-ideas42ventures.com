          Who can be a founder?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There’s no one way to be a founder. Some founders will have a strong track 
          record of work with a particular social problem. Others might have 
          particular technical, design, or business skills. But all of our founders 
          will be excited about using technology to solve social problems, and will 
          bring this excitement and deep passion to their work.
        </p>
      </header>
      <div class="apply__founders-body">
        <p>
          Additionally, our founders will bring <strong class="gradient-text">direct, lived experience</strong> of the 
          challenges Americans from underrepresented communities face to their work. 
          What is lived experience? It might be the knowledge of our broken 
          healthcare system that you have from spending hours on the phone with an 
          insurance company. Or maybe it’s what you know about the challenges of 
          unpredictable shift scheduling from juggling multiple part-time jobs. Put 
          simply, we believe that having a direct connection to the myriad 
          hallenges facing people with low incomes will help founders build 
          stronger, more impactful businesses, and will sustain our founders’ 
          passion through the inevitable ups and downs of starting a business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from this experience, our founders will have several key traits. 
          They will be <strong class="gradient-text">resourceful</strong>: able to inspire others to work for, fund, and 
          contribute to their eventual company. They will be <strong class="gradient-text">gritty</strong>: able to stick 
          with the challenges of starting a business, especially when it is hard. 
          They will be <strong class="gradient-text">emotionally mature</strong>: able to understand the perspectives of 
          others and interrogate their own perspectives when making challenging 
          decisions. They will have <strong class="gradient-text">high acceleration</strong>: able to start solving a 
          problem with something small and grow it quickly. And importantly, they 
          will be <strong class="gradient-text">creative</strong>: able to think of novel solutions to complex problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many ways to demonstrate these traits: through work and 
          professional experience, through volunteering, or through other personal 
          experiences. We care about what you’ve done in the past, but we care more 
          about what you <strong class="gradient-text">can do</strong> in the future. If these traits sound like you, and 
          you’re excited about the chance to make social impact through technology, 
          we encourage you to apply.
